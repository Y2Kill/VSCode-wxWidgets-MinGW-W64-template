# Some notes about thees examples
1. If you use wxPuts wxPrintf or other wx wrappers for standard CRT functions add: <u>#include <wx/crt.h></u> directive. More details about it you can find [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57018383/why-doesnt-clion-recognise-wxputs)
2. There are some note files with additional, but almost useless info :).
3. You have more examples? Add them - this'll be great :).
